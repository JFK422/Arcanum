# Arcanum
A small tool for generating, encrypting and saving passwords, notes and files.

On startup it will show a dialog to connect to a database where the passwords and notes will be stored.
Have a look at the code and adjust it to your needs to ensure a correct connection!

Notes:
-I can't guarante that your passwords will be secure. Use this programm at your own risk.
-For encryption the python-gnupg module is used.
-No data will be saved locally. (You need to reenter your connection data every time, unless changed in the code!)
