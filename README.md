# Arcanum
A small tool for generating, encrypting and saving passwords, notes and files.

On startup it will show a dialog to connect to a database where the passwords and notes will be stored.
Feel free to have a look around and modfiy the code to your needs.

**Notes:**
-I can't guarante that your passwords will be secure. Use this programm at your own risk.  
-For encryption the python-gnupg module is used.  
-The connection data will not be saved.
