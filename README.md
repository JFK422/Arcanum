A small tool for saving encrypted passwords in a local database.

On startup it will show a key, note it down and store it somewhere save.
Use this key then whenever you want to access your passwords.

NOTE:

-Have a look a the issues tab on here first before using!

-Editing and searching is sofar not supported, but I plan on adding it in a future release.
