# Axon
A small tool for saving encrypted passwords in a database.

On startup it will show a dialog to connect to a database. The information will then be encrypted and stored 
in this database. Have a look at the code and adjust it to your needs (tables, encryption, etc.).

NOTE:

-Have a look a the issues tab on here first before using!

-Editing and searching is sofar not supported, but I plan on adding it in a future release.
