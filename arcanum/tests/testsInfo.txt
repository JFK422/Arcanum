**This is just a file to help me with test as I am unfamiliar with them!**

#Check the output of a function
assert stuff == WhatItShouldBe

#Skip Tests
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="I dont care!")
@pytest.mark.skipif(conditionToSkip, reason="I do care!")

#Test
Name a function/method
    test_... to run tests on it. (Same for the file!)
    setup_... to run it before the tests.
    teardown_... to run it after the tests.

#Fixtures
@pytest.fixture
def someting():
    return WhateverIsNeeded

    yield WhateverIsNeeded
    Execute a teardown_...

def thing(someting):
    WhateverIsNeeded.exec()

Setup only once!
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
